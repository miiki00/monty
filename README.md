# Monty 0.98

# What is Monty ?

Monty is a simple interpreted [Stack-oriented scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) with no capability of coditional decision making. It was a school project from our school ALX Holberton.<br>
Here is an example input output of the monty interpreter.
```
$ cat file      
push 121 # pushs an element to the top of the stack.
push 100
push 111
push 98
push 121
push 114
push 101
push 118
push 69
push 32
push 105
push 72
pstr # prints all the values from top to bottom with respective ascii value.
pall # print all the stack elements
add  # add the top two elements of the stack
mul  # multiplies the to two elements of the stack.
rotl # puts the top element of the stack at the end of the stack.
pall
rotr # puts the bottom element of the stack at the top of the stack
pall

$ monty file

## Installation Guide

First clone the repo to your local machin by executing the folowing command in your terminal, assuming that you have git installed on your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/miiki00/monty.git
```
After you have the source locally it is easy to build monty. You just have to have a C compiler on your machine. In this example I am using [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
```
cd monty/
gcc -std=gnu89 *.c -o monty
```
Then if you want to play with often you can add it to one of your $PATH environment so you don't have to go to the installed directory every time you want to execute monty<br>
> Tip: on most UNIX-like system `/usr/bin` is where most of your executables are stored on windows it may have a different step so feel free to scrap the internet a little
> When I mean monty I am talking about the executable and not the direcotry.
```
mv monty /path/to/one/of/your/path/environment/
```

You can also use it with out adding it to your path. here is how and also assuming you are in the directory where the executable is located.
```
./monty file
```
## Monty's operators/commands.

| Command | Description |
|:---	  |:---			|
| push	  | Adds an integer into the stacks top syntax:`push <integer>`. |
| pall    | Prints all the integers in the stack. |
| pop     | Delets the top element of the stack. |
| pint	  | Prints the top element of the stack. |
| swap	  | Swaps the index of top and the second top element. |
| add	  | Adds the top two elements and stors the sum at the second element and deletes the top element. |
| nop	  | Does nothing. |
| sub	  | Just like add but instead of adding it is for substracting the top element from the second element. |
| mul     | Just like add but instead of adding it is for multiplying the top two elements by each other. |
| div 	  | Just like add but instead of adding it is for dividing the second element by the top one. |
| mod     | Just like add but instead of adding it is for find the mod of the second element divided by the top. |
| pchar   | Prints the top element's corresponding assci value it it have one else error will be printed. |
| pstr	  | Prints the stack element's correspoonding assci value and it won't stop until NUll terminator is found, stack ends or value is out of range |
| rotl    | Takes the top element of the stack an puts it at the end. |
| rotr    | Takes the last element and puts it at the top. |
| stack   | note: not implemented yet. The stack follow LIFO properties. |
| queue   | note: not implemented yet. The stack follows FIFO properties. |
